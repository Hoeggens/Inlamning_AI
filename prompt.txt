{
    First, I want this project to be a GitHub repository.
    Generate a README file, a .gitignore file and a MIT license file.
    After that, create a prompt.txt file. I will save all the prompts that I give you there.
}


{
    Now, I want you to generate files with code for a contactbook app for me in C++ with a TUI. 
    You are supposed to be able to add and save contacts with multiple emails, phone numbers, etc. 
    I want to be able to search for a name, phone number, and email to get the whole contact. 
    Remember to add every prompt to prompt.txt at the end of the prompt.txt file.

    Create the following files:
    1. main.cpp - This will contain the main function and the TUI logic.
    2. Contact.h - This will contain the definition of the Contact class.
    3. Contact.cpp - This will contain the implementation of the Contact class.
    4. ContactBook.h - This will contain the definition of the ContactBook class.
    5. ContactBook.cpp - This will contain the implementation of the ContactBook class.
    6. prompt.txt - This will contain all the prompts used.
    7. CMakeLists.txt - This will contain the build configuration.

    Add the necessary code to each file to implement the functionality described. I will run this project from Ubuntu.
}

{
    Now I would like to add a database to save all the contacts for my project, MySQL.
    Please help me set up the database, write the connection code, and create the necessary tables.
}


{
    Now I want you to update the README file with instructions on how this project works and how to run it properly.
}
